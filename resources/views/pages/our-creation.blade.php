                       Himalayan Dog Chews were born from an ancient recipe for a hard
                        cheese snack chewed by the people of the Himalayas.
                         In the mountains surrounding
                        Mt. Everest at more than 15,000 feet, it is made using traditional
                         methods with yak and/or cow milk, and all natural products with no 
                         preservatives or binding agents. They're also gluten-free!
                        Depending on the size and eating habits of the dog, this 
                        can be a very long-lasting dog chew. Dogs must work the end 
                        of the treat for hours, softening it with their mouths before 
                        small parts of it can be slowly chewed off. When you give this 
                        treat to your dog, you know that you are providing them with 
                        high-quality eating entertainment.
