        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <div class="mission-wrapper second-wrapper">
            <h5> Value of Care:</h5>
            <p> Driven by the philanthropic nature of our organization, our care centralizes towards the health of our milking animals, well-being of the hard working team members, pet owners and the pets who rely on the products we produce. 
              Our care towards milking animals begins right from their birth. Periodically, we provide fresh and refresher trainings to our less-educated farmers to translate their skills into expertise, and make them knowledgeable and competent enough to implement best measures in ensuring good health of our milking animals. With utmost care, these yaks and cows grow healthier, reproduces on time, and provides quality milk. </p>
              <p>With care for human resources of Royal Dog Chew in mind, we do not hesitate in knowledge sharing and capacity building of our meager-earning famers who work in risk-abundant areas, which in return, helps them to minimize their losses and maximizes profits. Besides, along with the health of pets, we understand the extremity of concerns about health of pets among pet owners, and thus, our care concentrates on every minute steps of production which are involved in the making of Royal Dog Chew. </p>

              <h5>Value of Ecology: </h5>
              <p>Himalayan regions of Nepal, the habitation of yaks and cows who give milk for Royal Dog Chew, is not a left-out place where climate change has taken its toll on. In an average, 25 percent of yaks used to get failed in producing milk due to environment-induced health related problems, including miscarriage and unsuccessful fertilization. But ever since the production of hard cheese for Royal Dog Chew escalated, farmers have realized the worldwide demand of pure milk of yaks and cows, and have started to value their domesticated cows and yaks. </p>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="mission-wrapper">
          <p>Now, the farmers shower utmost care and deepest love onto them unlike yesteryears, which is playing a vital role in the conservation of endangered animal like yak. Besides, the farmers have understood the value of natural pasture and vegetation, and are leaving no stone unturned to cultivate quality fodder and forage, and stay vigilant against the misuse of plants and grasses that grow in their neighborhoods. </p>

          <h5>Value of Health:</h5>
          <p>Keeping the health of dog as the primary concern, Royal Dog Chew US, does not produce dog treat that contains rawhide, high fat, gluten, grain, binding agent, lactose, gluten, artificial colorants, chemicals or preservatives; however, we conduct off-farm and on-farm quality testing and processing at various levels to produce quality dog treat. </p>
          <p>We ensure that the final product have low fat, high protein, and contain 4 wholesome ingredients, including lime, salt and pure milk extracted from non-cross-bred yak, cow or chauri who graze in natural pasture land and vegetation of higher altitudes of Nepal (above 4,500 ft). </p>

          <h5>Values of Fair Economy:</h5>
          <p>Tens of thousands of poverty-stricken farmers living in the higher altitudes of Nepal depend on milk-based occupation who collects milk by traditional method of hand-milking, and sells them in the local market, either for the production of Churpis or for other milk-based products ̶ most of them having no sustainable markets. Our team members trek up in the higher regions of Nepal untouched by accessible roads, and contributes in maximizing their sales through which their livelihood has been sustained, which in return, gives us immense pleasure to showcase the artworks of these talented women in the world. </p>

          <div class="mission-wrapper second-wrapper">
            <p> Nepal is a nation of yak cheese eaters and one of the few places in the world where yak milk is used for making cheese, a widely loved form of souvenir. Royal Dog Chews are made from yak and local cow milk who depends on grasses, leaves, fodder and forage that grow in natural pasture and vegetation of higher altitude (above 4,500 feet) of Nepal. Our milking animals are not fed with chemicals-mixed food materials or contaminated food, antibiotics and hormones. </p>
            <p>In 2008, a team of researchers led by a Professor Brian McBride, at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, concluded that yak cheese has three times more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids than cheddar cheese.</p>
            <p>In an average, 25 percent of yaks used to get failed in producing milk due to climate change-induced health related problems, including miscarriage and unsuccessful fertilization.</p>
            <p>We are encouraging our farmers to protect the natural pasture and vegetation, and cultivate quality fodder and forage to enhance the free range feeding of our animals. </p>

Almost all of these street dogs are dependent on leftovers and garbage, and are likely to get diseases that can develop tumors inside them. </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> As a Corporate Social Responsibility, we are allocating certain percentage of our profits to implement dog feeding campaigns, especially for those street dogs, who are suffering from lack of healthy food, kindness and care. </p>
